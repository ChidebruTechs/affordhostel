        <h1>Quick Access to the client's fragmented pages</h1>
        <p>This web app is intended to help campus students find hostel from the comfort of their phone without the need to mannually scout around for diaspora accommodation as has been the norm. It is expected to scale upto all the compuses nationwide. The project is expected to be complete by 31st July 2025 focusing on Maseno at the launch in August targeting Septembe intake. </p>
        <p>Please use this page to navigate quickly through the rough sketches by the client</p>
        <p>Make the hostel view layout cards like those in <a href="https://www.bomayangu.go.ke/">Boma Yangu</a>  website.</p>
        <h2><span style="font-weight: 900; color: crimson;">N/B:</span> I've just created this page for your understanding. I haven't added anything so far. I forked the project from the client's GitHub and found the files as they are. He is not a developer, just a curious DIY guy. In the homepage, use any number and random Password, it will just accept so that you can have insight into the dropdowns for the areas and type of hosotels available.  I want to create a new branch for development and set up the development environment witn REACT and DJANGO</h2>
